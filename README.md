## Small Issue
I accidentally put all my stuff in the wrong repo so this is me just moving stuff, sorry.

## What you built?

I created a simple maze game with Unity which included

* Sound effects
* Enemies
  * Stationary 
  * Moving 
* Game over
* Winning the game

## What I learned

I had briefly toyed around with Unity before but not a great extent. I got comfortable with creating prefabs, using node graphs for animators, and learning C#.
